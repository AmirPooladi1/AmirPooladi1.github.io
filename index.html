        His eyes are beautiful his lips make me want to kiss him but... <br />
        I haven't even seen him in The Real Life
        <br /><br />Our Story: <br /><br />
        Well I said havn't ever meet him in the real life so <br />evrything
        started when I was on WhatsApp in that time I was really trying to focus
        on work so I used to hide other's status <br />
        so I was on WhatsApp checking my messages and replying ... <br />But all
        of a sudden I taped on the hidden status of my friend called Nadia and
        the status popped up <br />
        It was a text and I decided to reply to her status <br />She just
        replied back and we started chatting she said wanna join a group chat
        with my firends ?? <br />I said okay ... <br /><br />Actually to be
        honest I met many friends that night but there was an awesome boy called
        Amirhossein he was smart and handsome he was perfect his behavior made
        me fall in Love with him <br /><br />After that awesome night I always
        thanked God for showing me that status for guiding me to that group chat
        and now ...
      </p>

    <div id="sorry">

        I finally changed myself I fially learned to love myself ...
        unfortunately I messed up my relationship just because of some stupid
        insecurities but I'm creating this website to tell you I love you so
        much I miss you I just want our relationship to be just like those old
        days <br />But I'll expiate everything <br />
        <br />
        Let me tell you the story of that magical day ... <br />I was crying all
        day I talked to my parents and they were shoked that i'm talking about
        my insecurities against them cause i never do that <br />I was upset i
        took a thousand selfies but none of them were beautiful in my eyes i was
        hopeless I just wanted to die but something magical happend... <br />I
        searched for "Idols without makup" <br />I was shoked even those
        Beautiful Idols were horrible without makup even worse than me how can i
        expect myself to be beautiful when i don't even try a bit to be a
        beautiful girl so yep <br />
        Beauty is something to achieve and not something you should have from
        the beginning of Life! <br />After that magical day I learned how to
        love myself and improve my appearance in a healthy way actually I'm
        really happier now <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        And look i wanna apologize for everything I've done till now but I was
        sick what's important is that i finally cahnged myself...
